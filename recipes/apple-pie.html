    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Apple pie is a beloved American dessert featuring a flaky, buttery crust filled with tender, cinnamon-spiced 
        apples. This classic comfort food balances the sweet and tart flavors of the apples with a warm, cozy aroma 
        that is irresistible. Perfect for any occasion, it can be served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or 
        enjoyed on its own.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 Granny Smith Apples</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>9 inch double-crust pie pastry, room temperature</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425F (220C). </li>
        <li>Peel, core, and cut the apples into thin slices. Sprinkle with cinnamon and set aside for later.</li>
        <li>Brown butter in a saucepan, then stir in the flour until pasty and fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add sugars and water, then bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce to a simmer for 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place one of pie pastries into a greased pie dish, then cut the other pastry into 1-inch strips.</li>
        <li>Fill the pastry in the pie dish with the cinnamon-apple mixture, slightly mounded.</li>
        <li>Weave the pastry strips over top of the apples and pinch the strip ends into the bottom pastry edges.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the sugar-butter glaze over the pastry lattice and into the apples beneath, but take care not to 
            drip down the sides into the dish.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes at 425F (220C), then reduce to 350F (175 C) for another 40 minutes, until apples are 
            soft</li>
        <li>Serve topped with ice cream!</li>
    </ol>
