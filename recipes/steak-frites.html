    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A timeless French bistro classic, this steak frites recipe features a perfectly seared steak paired with a 
        generous pile of crispy, golden fries. A simple yet elegant meal, it comes together quickly for a delicious 
        weeknight dinner or a special at-home date night. The dish is often served with a rich, savory sauce, such as a 
        compound herb butter or a creamy peppercorn sauce, drizzled over the juicy, tender steak.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 russet potatoes, cut into strips</li>
        <li>2 12-ounce New York strip steaks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 dozen sprigs thyme, fresh</li>
        <li>1 dozen cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>Fries/Frites</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the fries in a bowl of ice water and agitate to remove extra starch.</li>
        <li>Rinse the fries and dry thoroughly. If there is time, freeze the potatoes and allow them to thaw before 
            cooking.</li>
        <li>Place fries into deep fryer at 300 degrees for 3 minutes. Remove from oil and place on a paper towel to soak
            up any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Set aside and preheat the oven for 350F. These will be cooked for 5 minutes immediately prior to serving the
            completed dish.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Steak</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Generously season all sides of the steak with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pan over high heat and add the steak once smoking, reducing the heat to 
            medium.</li>
        <li>Allow the steak to sear, about 3 minutes, before flipping.</li>
        <li>Add thyme, garlic and butter to the pan, and cook for another 3 minutes (for medium-rare) while basting
            with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from the pan and allow to rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>After the steak has rested and the fries are out of the oven, plate together with your favorite sauce.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy!</p>
