# odin-recipes

This project creates a website that links to 3 recipes:
- Spaghetti
- Steak Frites
- Apple Pie

Within this project I hand-wrote the HTML boilerplates for each .html file, added photos to each file from a free image source, wrote some (admittedly low-effort) recipes to link from the homepage, and experimented with using two ordered lists in the Steak Frites recipe, as the meal has two parts, the steak and the fries.
